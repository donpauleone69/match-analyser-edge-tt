1. Match-Level Performance Statistics (Macro)

These give an overview of who is winning and why.

1.1 Scoring Statistics

Points won/lost on serve (side A / side B)

Points won/lost on receive

Point streaks

Clutch points → 9–9+, deuce, game points

Game-to-game momentum shifts

Win % when rally > 5 shots (long rally wins)

1.2 Serve/Receive Balance

Serve efficiency = % points won on serve

Receive efficiency = % points won on opponent serve

Serve error rate (including serve-receive punish errors)

🧭 2. Tactical Statistics (Most Valuable for Coaching)

These matter the most in modern TT analysis.

2.1 3rd/4th Ball Efficiency

3rd ball attack success

3rd ball winner rate

3rd ball forced error rate

4th ball counter-attack success

4th ball blocking success

2.2 Opening Quality

Opening loop quality (spin, depth, placement)

Opening loop to different zones

% of openings that provoke weak balls

Opponent’s opening quality & your block/counter rate

2.3 Initiative Control

Who is “in control” of the rally?

Initiative win rate (player who attacked first wins)

Initiative steal rate (player who countered the first attack wins)

Passive → active transition points

🎯 3. Shot-Level Quality Metrics (For AI Training Later)

All of these can be inferred from tagged rallies + AI-enhanced video.

3.1 Shot Type Frequency

Forehand loop / Backhand loop

Flicks (FH/BH)

Open push, short push, long push

Counter-loop

Chop / defensive shots

Smashes, kills

3.2 Spin-Based Metrics

Spin category inferred (under / top / no-spin / side)

Serve spin profile

Return-of-serve spin adaptation success

3.3 Placement Zones

Analysed by grid (e.g., 3×3 / 4×4):

Deep vs short

Wide FH / wide BH

Body shots

Metrics:

Winner rate by zone

Error rate by zone

Opponent weakness exposure

3.4 Trajectory & Contact Quality

AI-inferred:

Ball speed estimate

Shot quality index (speed + depth + spin)

Recovery time / footwork delay

🔍 4. Error Statistics (Crucial for Improvement)

Errors usually decide pro matches.

4.1 Unforced Errors

Serve unforced errors

Receive unforced errors

Open attack unforced errors

Rally unforced errors

4.2 Forced Errors

When opponent’s shot directly causes the error
(Useful for identifying what shots force weak responses.)

4.3 Shot-Type Error Profile

For each shot type:

Frequency

Error %

Winner %

Neutral outcome %

This produces a heatmap of strengths/weaknesses.

🔄 5. Rally Structure Statistics

Helps identify patterns.

5.1 Rally Length Distribution

1–2 shots

3–5 shots

6–9 shots

10+ shots

5.2 Who wins long rallies vs short rallies
5.3 Touch Shots vs Power Shots Ratio

Touch exchanges (serve, receive, push, short game)

Attack exchanges

Counter-attack exchanges

🗺 6. Positional & Footwork Inferences (AI Phase 2+)

These can be approximated manually or fully detected via pose tracking.

Distance from table at impact

FH/BH positional balance

Footwork patterns (in–out, lateral, crossover)

Recovery delays

Forced movement events

Analytics:

Win % when forced wide

Points lost due to late recovery

Opponent footwork inefficiency exploitation

📈 7. Opponent Scouting Metrics

Especially important for tournament prep.

Serve tendencies by score (e.g., 9–9 patterns)

Preferred 3rd ball zone

Weak zones on receive

Preferred rally patterns

Shot-type overuse habits

Pressure behaviour

🔥 Summary: The Most Important For Top-Level Analysis
Core 5 Metrics (World-class standard)

Serve / Receive effectiveness

3rd / 4th ball efficiency

Opening quality & consistency

Initiative control

Error profile (forced vs unforced)
