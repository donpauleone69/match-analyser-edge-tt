# MVP Current State & Roadmap

> **Version:** 3.0  
> **Last Updated:** 2025-12-11  
> **Status:** Living Document

This document consolidates:
- Current implementation status (v3.0)
- In-progress features
- Future roadmap

**Supersedes:** MVP_flowchange_spec.md, MVP_flowchange_tasks.md, and all Phase1_Setup_Flow_*.md files

---

## Current State (v3.0) - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Core Workflow - Three-Phase Tagging

**Phase 1: Match Framework (Timestamp Tagging)**
- ✅ Mark shot contact times with button clicks
- ✅ System creates shots and rallies with timestamps
- ✅ Auto-derives server, receiver, rally structure
- ✅ Multi-video support (multiple video segments per match)
- ✅ Set setup flow (starting score, first server)
- ✅ Pause/resume capability

**Phase 2: Rally Detail (Question Answering)**
- ✅ Review each shot sequentially
- ✅ Answer questions: intent, quality, shot type, direction, spin
- ✅ System updates shot attributes
- ✅ Constrained video playback (loops around shot)
- ✅ Progress tracking

**Phase 3: Inference & Analytics**
- ✅ Inference engine for shot-level data
- ✅ Analytics cards (serve, receive, third ball, rally stats, error profile)
- ✅ Filter by player, match, date range
- ✅ Insights and coaching recommendations

### Data Management

**Entities (9 total):**
- ✅ Players, Clubs, Tournaments
- ✅ Matches, MatchVideos, Sets
- ✅ Rallies, Shots, ShotInferences

**Storage:**
- ✅ Local-first (IndexedDB via Dexie.js)
- ✅ Slug-based IDs (human-readable)
- ✅ Zustand for UI state
- ✅ Persistent storage with session recovery

**Data Flow:**
- ✅ Top-down result entry (pre-enter match/set scores)
- ✅ Bottom-up verification (tagging validates scores)
- ✅ Tagged data = source of truth

### UI Features

**Match Management:**
- ✅ Create/edit matches
- ✅ Match result entry modal
- ✅ Set selection for tagging
- ✅ Match list with scores

**Player/Tournament Management:**
- ✅ Player CRUD with club assignment
- ✅ Tournament CRUD with context
- ✅ Club management

**Video Features:**
- ✅ Local video file handling (blob URLs)
- ✅ Multiple playback speeds (0.25x - 5x)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Constrained playback (Phase 2)
- ✅ FF mode toggle (Phase 1)

**Analytics:**
- ✅ 5 analytics cards (Serve, Receive, Third Ball, Rally Stats, Error Profile)
- ✅ Filter bar (player, match, date)
- ✅ Insights generation
- ✅ Status indicators (good/average/poor)

### Technical Architecture

**Tech Stack:**
- ✅ React 19 + Vite 7 + TypeScript 5.9
- ✅ React Router 7 + Zustand 5 + Dexie 4
- ✅ Tailwind 4 + Radix UI + Lucide Icons
- ✅ HTML5 Video API + FFmpeg.wasm

**Patterns:**
- ✅ Feature-first folder structure
- ✅ Rules layer (derive/calculate/infer/validate/analytics)
- ✅ Entity pattern (types → db → store)
- ✅ Composers → Sections → Blocks
- ✅ Pure domain logic separated from UI

---
