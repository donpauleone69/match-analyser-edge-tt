- Each match card shows:
  - Player names (bold): "Marcus vs Chen"
  - Date: "Nov 28, 2025"
  - Score: "3-2"
  - Status badges: "Step 1 ✓" (green), "Step 2 Pending" (amber)
- Cards have subtle hover state

Right column:
- Large primary CTA button "New Match" with plus icon
- Below: compact stats summary card titled "Your Week"
  - Shows: "Matches: 4 | Rallies Tagged: 187"

Color scheme: Dark charcoal background (#1a1a1a), card backgrounds slightly lighter (#252525), accent color teal (#14b8a6) for CTAs, white text, muted secondary text (#9ca3af)

Typography: Use a geometric sans-serif like "DM Sans" or "Plus Jakarta Sans"
