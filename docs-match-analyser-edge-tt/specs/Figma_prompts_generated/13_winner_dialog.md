Design a modal dialog for selecting the rally winner.

Layout:
- Overlay: Dark semi-transparent backdrop (#000 at 60% opacity)
- Centered modal card (400px width, rounded corners)

Modal content:
- Title: "Who won the point?"
- Two large buttons stacked vertically:
  - "Player 1 — Marcus" (full width, substantial height ~60px)
  - "Player 2 — Chen" (full width, ~60px)
- Both buttons have hover/active states
- No cancel button (user must select)

Color scheme: Modal background #252525, buttons in teal (#14b8a6), white text

Typography: Title centered and bold, button text large and clear

Style: Minimal, fast to tap, impossible to miss the choice. Modal should appear instantly after "End Rally — Score" tap.
